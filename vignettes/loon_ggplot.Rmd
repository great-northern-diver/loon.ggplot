## Introduction

`loon.ggplot` is a R package to transform `ggplot` graphics into interactive `loon` graphics.

## 1. Basic usage

```{r basic uasge, message=FALSE}
library(loon.ggplot)
g1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
lp1 <- loon.ggplot(g1)
```

*ggplot*
```{r basic show ggplot, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
g1
```

*loon plot*

`loon` provides `loonGrob` to transform `loon` graphics to `grid` `grob`s, then to capture the static display.

```{r basic show loonplot, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
library(grid)
grid.loon(lp1)
```

The points can be selected in `loon` plot

```{r selected loonplot, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
cyl4 <- which((mtcars$cyl == 4) == TRUE)
lp1$x1y1['selected'][cyl4] <- TRUE
grid.loon(lp1)
```

Also, more interesting actions can be achieved, like changing color, size, glyph types and etc. In this vignette, we just use 'selected' to highlight and show difference. Please take a look at [`loon` display](http://waddella.github.io/loon/learn_R_display_plot.html) for more details (Notice, the output of `loon.ggplot` is a list and each element is the corresponding `loon` plot).

### 1.1.Coordinates and `ggGuides`

Let us look at the following example
```{r ggplot with polar coordinates, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, message=FALSE}
library(ElemStatLearn)
g1.1 <- ggplot(SAheart, aes(obesity, adiposity)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
g1.1
```

The graphics are projected on the polar coordinates system with respect to "adiposity" (It is a pretty weird plot but does demonstrate how coordinate systems are abstracted out as part of the grammar.)

```{r loonplot with polar coordinates, fig.width = 3.8, fig.height = 4}
lp1.1 <- loon.ggplot(g1.1)
grid.loon(lp1.1)
```

However, this `loon` plot is a bit confusing without any guidance. As the shown help message,  how about trying to set argument "ggGuides = TRUE"?
```{r loonplot with ggGuides, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 4.5}
lp1.1_ggGuides <- loon.ggplot(g1.1, ggGuides = TRUE)
grid.loon(lp1.1_ggGuides)
```

`ggGuides` will return a `ggplot` object coordinates system (polar or Cartesian). It is extremely helpful under polar coordinates system, since this system is very difficult to interpret without any guiding.

### 1.2.Which one is active?

```{r ggplot histogram and density line, fig.width = 3.5, fig.height = 3, message=FALSE}
g1.2.1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_point(data = data.frame(x = mtcars$mpg, y = 0), 
             mapping = aes(x, y), 
            color = "steelblue", size = 3) +
  geom_density()
g1.2.1
```

```{r loonplot but with different active layers, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
library(gridExtra)
## check difference
lp1.2.1.1 <- loon.ggplot(g1.2.1, active_geomLayers = 1)

suppressWarnings(
  lp1.2.1.2 <- loon.ggplot(g1.2.1, active_geomLayers = 2)
)

grid.arrange(loonGrob(lp1.2.1.1), loonGrob(lp1.2.1.2), ncol = 2, top = "lp1.2.1.1 and lp1.2.1.2")
```

It seems no big difference between these two plots except the **warnings**. That is because, in `loon.ggplot`, the `linkingKey`(will be introduced in **1.3**) is set by the *plot data* (in `p1.2.1`, it is "mtcars"), if the data to be displayed in active geom layer is inherited from the *plot data*, `linkingKey` would be set correctly and no warnings; if not, the displayed data will override the *plot data* and `linkingKey` will be reset, in this situation, the `linkingKey` may not be linked correctly and warnings will occur.  

Let us select the data larger than 20.
```{r selected loonplot with different active layers, fig.width = 7.5, fig.height = 3.5}
lp1.2.1.1$x1y1['selected'][mtcars$mpg > 20] <- TRUE
lp1.2.1.2$x1y1['selected'][mtcars$mpg > 20] <- TRUE
grid.arrange(loonGrob(lp1.2.1.1), loonGrob(lp1.2.1.2), ncol = 2, top = "lp1.2.1.1 and lp1.2.1.2")
```

`active_geomLayers` is helping to set which geom layer is active. The geom layers in `p1.2.1` are `geom_histogram()`, `geom_point()` and `geom_density()`. `active_geomLayers = 1` indicates `geom_histogram()` will be active. In `loon`, only `geom_histogram()`and `geom_point()` can be active so far, meanwhile, they cannot be active at the same time.

```{r show errors, eval=FALSE}
# Error
lp1.2.1.3 <- loon.ggplot(g1.2.1, active_geomLayers = 3)
# Error in activeInfo(importantLayers, active_geomLayers, len_layers) : This layer cannot be active
lp1.2.1.4 <- loon.ggplot(g1.2.1, active_geomLayers = c(1,2))
# Error in activeInfo(importantLayers, active_geomLayers, len_layers) : histogram layer and point layer cannot be active at the same time
```

What if we have multiple point layers?

```{r ggplot with several point layers, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3.5}
df <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(120, c(0, 2, 4)),
  y = rnorm(120, c(1, 2, 1)),
  z = letters[1:3]
)
df2 <- dplyr::select(df, -z)
g1.2.2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(data = df2, colour = "grey70") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = z)) +
  facet_wrap(~z)
g1.2.2
```

```{r selected loonplot with several point layers, warning=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(
  lp1.2.2.1 <- loon.ggplot(g1.2.2, active_geomLayers = 1)
)
lp1.2.2.2 <- loon.ggplot(g1.2.2, active_geomLayers = 2)

suppressWarnings(
  lp1.2.2.3 <- loon.ggplot(g1.2.2, active_geomLayers = c(1,2))
)
```

`lp1.2.2.2` has more statistical meanings than the other two. Let us select the points in three facets
```{r selected loonplot with several point layers layout, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=7, fig.show='hold'}
# lp1.2.2.1
sel_lp1.2.2.1 <- lapply(lp1.2.2.1, 
                      function(loon_plot){
                        loon_plot['selected'] <- TRUE
                      })
# lp1.2.2.2
sel_lp1.2.2.2 <- lapply(lp1.2.2.2, 
                      function(loon_plot){
                        loon_plot['selected'] <- TRUE
                      })
# lp1.2.2.3
sel_lp1.2.2.3 <- lapply(lp1.2.2.3, 
                      function(loon_plot){
                        loon_plot['selected'] <- TRUE
                      })
grid.arrange(
  textGrob(
    c("Check","the", "big" ,"difference!"), 
    x = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8),
    y = c(0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2),
    gp = gpar(col = "grey80", fontsize = 18),
    rot = c(30, 60, 30, 60)
  ),
  loonGrob(lp1.2.2.1), 
  loonGrob(lp1.2.2.2),
  loonGrob(lp1.2.2.3), 
  ncol = 2, 
  nrow = 2,
  top = "lp1.2.2.1 and lp1.2.2.2 and lp1.2.2.3")
```

In this example, the active points should be the colorful ones; the grey points are background and should **not** be activated. In `ggplot` object, the first layer is the grey point layer, thus we need to set `active_geomLayers` as **2**. That is why `lp1.2.2.2` is more appropriate than the rest (no warnings).

Also, you can reset the `ggplot` model as

```{r reset ggplot, eval = F}
g1.2.2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = z)) +
  geom_point(data = df2, colour = "grey70") +
  facet_wrap(~z) 
```     

Then, `lp1.2.2.1` would be the appropriate one.

### 1.3.`linkingGroup` and `linkingKey`

`loon` has a powerful interactive system, `linkingKey` and `linkingGroup`, so that some of their $n$ dimensional states can be synchronized. Displays are linked if their share the same `linkingGroup`; the $n$ dimensional `linkingKey` state controls which elements get synchronized between the linked displays. More details are shown in  [`loon` linking](http://waddella.github.io/loon/learn_R_linking.html).

```{r ggplot arranged plots, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5, fig.show='hold', message=FALSE}
g1.3.1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, colour = as.factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
g1.3.2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, fill = as.factor(cyl))) + geom_histogram()
grid.arrange(g1.3.1, g1.3.2, ncol = 2)
```

```{r selected loonplot with linkingGroup and linkingKey, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, fig.show='hold'}
lp1.3.1 <- loon.ggplot(g1.3.1, linkingGroup = "mtcars")
lp1.3.2 <- loon.ggplot(g1.3.2, linkingGroup = "mtcars")
lp1.3.1$x1y1['selected'][which((mtcars$cyl == 4) == TRUE)] <- TRUE
# or
# lp1.3.2$x1y1['selected'][which((mtcars$cyl == 4) == TRUE)] <- TRUE
grid.arrange(loonGrob(lp1.3.1), loonGrob(lp1.3.2), ncol = 2)
```

### 1.4.Handle `geom_curve`

```{r geom_curve in loonplot, eval=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 1:3)
df2 <- data.frame(x = c(1,3), y = c(1,3), 
                  xend = c(2,2), yend = c(2,2))
g1.4 <- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_curve(aes(x = x ,y = y, 
                 xend = xend, yend = yend),
             data = df2,
             color = c("red", "blue"))
loon.ggplot(g1.4)
```

Most geom layers in `ggplot` object are straight forward except `geom_curve`. Control points of `geom_curve` are from `curve grob` in `grid` and these points can only be achieved at the drawing time. Thus, "askYesorNo" option is generated, if `ggplot` graphics are drawn, curves would be shown in `loon` (or curves are replaced by segments).

## 2.Pipe ggplot model via `gg_pipe`

One convenient programming style is that of pipes as developed in the package `magrittr`. 

```{r tidyverse, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
SAheart %>%
  mutate(ltob = log(tobacco), lsbp = log(sbp)) %>%
  filter(age < 50) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ltob, y = lsbp)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~chd) -> gg
# the plot will be drawn at the end
lp1.2 <- loon.ggplot(gg)
```

However, if we pipe `ggplot` as following, error will occur

```{r failed tidyverse when piping ggplot, eval=FALSE}
## Error occures 
SAheart %>%
  mutate(ltob = log(tobacco), lsbp = log(sbp)) %>%
  filter(age < 50) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ltob, y = lsbp)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~chd) %>% 
  loon.ggplot()
```

The reason is the precedence of signal "+" and "%>%". "%>%" takes the priority, thus 

       facet_wrap(~chd) %>% loon.ggplot()
would run in front of  

       ggplot(aes(x = ltob, y = lsbp)) +
         geom_point() +
         facet_wrap(~chd).

In `loon.ggplot`, `gg_pipe` packs the `ggplot` object and forces it to pass through in order.

```{r ggpipe, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
## Works
SAheart %>%
  mutate(ltob = log(tobacco), lsbp = log(sbp)) %>%
  filter(age < 50) %>%
  gg_pipe( 
    ggplot(aes(x = ltob, y = lsbp)) +
      geom_point() +
      facet_wrap(~chd) 
  ) %>% 
  loon.ggplot() %>%
  grid.loon()
```
