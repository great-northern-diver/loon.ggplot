Title: An add on package to loon that converts ggplot2 plots to interactive loon
    plots
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: c(
  person('Zehao', 'Xu', email = 'z267xu@uwaterloo.ca', role = c('aut', 'cre')),

Description: The \code{loon.ggplot} package brings both \code{loon} and \code{ggplot2} packages together. Data analysts who value the ease with which \code{ggplot2} can create meaningful graphics can now turn these \code{ggplot}s into interactive \code{loon} plots for more dynamic interaction with their data. Conversely, data analysts who explore data interactively can at any time turn a snapshot of their interactive \code{loon} plots into \code{ggplot}s. The former is accomplished by the simple translation function \code{ggplot2loon()} and the latter by the simple translation function \code{loon2ggplot()}.
