\title{loon.ggplot: An Add on Package to Loon that Converts ggplot2 Plots to Interactive Loon Plots}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: align='right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

The \code{loon.ggplot} package brings both \code{loon} and \code{ggplot2} packages together. Data analysts who value the ease with which \code{ggplot2} can create meaningful graphics can now turn these \code{ggplot2} objects into interactive \code{loon} plots for more dynamic interaction with their data. Conversely, data analysts who explore data interactively can at any time turn a snapshot of their interactive \code{loon} plots into \code{ggplot2} objects. The former is accomplished by the simple translation function \code{ggplot2loon()} and the latter by the simple translation function \code{loon2ggplot()}.
